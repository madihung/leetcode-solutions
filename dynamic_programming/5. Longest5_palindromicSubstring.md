# Longest Substring

```markdown
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
```

**********************************Brute Force Approach - consider all substrings**********************************

<aside>
ðŸ”§ Tip: for the `isPalidromic()` helper: save space by passing in the indices of the substring in s rather than the entire substring

</aside>

- Iterate through a range `for i in range(1, len(s))` to check for a palindromic substring of length `i` in s
    - By iterating backwards, we save time because the first palindromic sequence found would also be the longest palindromic sequence
    - For each substring length `i` , we search all possible substrings of that length in s by using a `start` ptr to track: `s[start] -> s[start + i - 1]`

```python
def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:

      def isPalindromic(start: int, end: int) -> bool:
          substring = s[start:(end+1)]
          l, r = 0, len(substring) - 1
          while l < r: # check
              if substring[l] != substring[r]:
                  return False
              l += 1
              r -= 1
          return True
        
      for i in range(len(s), 0, -1):
          for start in range(len(s) - i + 1):
              if isPalindromic(start, (start + i)):
                  return s[ptr:(start + i + 1)]
      return ""
```

- Time Complexity = O(n^3) - nested for loop, where each substring in the nested loops is run though again in isPalindromic
- Space Complexity = O(1)

**************Dynamic Programming**************

- Base case: a single letter is considered a palindrome
- Given the `start` and `end` of a palindromic substring, if `start - 1 == end + 1`, there is an even longer palindromic substring that is longer by 2 characters
- Create a `nxn` dp array where `dp[i][j] = True` if `s[i : j + 1]` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise
    - populate dp array so `dp[i][i] = True` â†’ all single character substrings are Palindromes
    - populate dp array so all palindromic substrings of length 2, `dp[i][i+1] = True`

```python
def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
      n = len(s)
      dp = [[False]*n for _ in range(n)]
      res = [0,0]

      # set all substrings of length 1 to True
      for i in range(n):
          dp[i][i] = True
      # set all palindromic substrings of length 2 to True
      for i in range(n-1):
          if s[i] == s[i+1]:
              dp[i][i+1] = True
              res = [i,i+1]
      
      # populate rest of dp table
      for diff in range(2,n):
          for i in range(n - diff):
              j = i + diff
              if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i+1][j-1]:
                  dp[i][j] = True
                  res = [i,j]

      start, end = res
      return s[start:end+1]
```

- Time complexity = O(n^2) - nested for loop
- Space complexity = O(n^2) for dp array
